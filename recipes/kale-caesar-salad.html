    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Traditional Caesar salad that uses kale instead of romaine! Makes 4 side-dish portions, but you can make it a main dish meal by topping it with a grilled protein, such as chicken or salmon! You may have leftover dressing, depending on how much you like. It keeps well in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 oil-packed anchovy fillets</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place mayonnaise, lemon juice, garlic, anchovies, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper in the bowl of a food processor. Process until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place kale in a large salad bowl. Using your hands, massage the kale to soften slightly. Add a few dollops of the dressing on top of the kale, and stir until all pieces are lightly coated with the dressing. Sprinkle with croutons and top with shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
    </ol>
